[BlobTools Guide](/BlobTools/README.md)

- BlobTools/BlobToolKit is a software suite that allows you to identify and isolate contaminent or non-target DNA from your genome assembly. This software integrate taxonomic information, coverage, and basis sequence stats to identify reads that are potentially contamination. All you need is your genome assembly (.fa, .fasta) and the reads that were used to build your genome assembly (.fq, .fastq)
